I'm a **Full Stack Developer** and a **Data Analyst** with **4 years** of experience. I got graduated with a Bachelor of Science *(2013)*, and also studied Electronic Engineering *(2014-2020)*.

My first coding experience was in 2013 with VBA. At the university, I learned some of C++, assembly, and MATLAB.  My first experience with **web development** was in 2019.

I've been **working as Data Analyst since 2018** in the gaming industry, where I usually **manage databases** and develop **frontend dashboards**.

Currently, I'm **looking for a new position** as a **Full Stack Developer** or **Frontend Developer**.
