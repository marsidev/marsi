I'm a **Software Developer** focused on the **frontend**, with <Age date='2019-12-01T00:00:00.000Z' /> years of experience. I got graduated with a **Bachelor of Science** _(2013)_ and studied **Electronic Engineering** _(2014-2020)_. My first coding experience was in 2013 with VBA. At the university, I learned some of C++, assembly, and MATLAB. My first experience with **web development** was in 2019. Currently, I'm **looking for a new position** as a **Frontend Developer**.
