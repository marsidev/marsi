I'm a **Full Stack Developer** and a **Data Analyst** with **4 years** of experience.

My first coding experience was in 2013 with VBA, then at the university, I learned C++, assembly, and MATLAB. Even I used to **teach C++** basics to other students. I had my first experience with **web development** in 2019.

I have been **working since 2018** as a Data Analyst in the gaming industry in different esports teams, where I’ve used to manage **databases** to track thousands of players, also in this role, I developed **frontend resources** such as dashboards and tools to improve my workspace.

Currently, I’m looking for a new position as a Full Stack Developer or Frontend Developer.
