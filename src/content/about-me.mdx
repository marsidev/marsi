I'm a **Full Stack Developer** and a **Data Analyst** with **4 years** of experience.

I've been interested in IT and coding since I was very young. My first coding experience was in 2013 (*17yo*) with VBA, where I made tools to automate repetitive tasks, such as a script to organize my *downloads* folder by file extensions.

Then at the university (*2014-2022*), I learned a bit of C++, assembly, and MATLAB. Even I used to **teach C++** basics to other students. 

I had my first experience with **web development** in 2019, by doing dashboards with <Link isExternal color='teal.300' href='https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/web'>Apps Script</Link>, HTML, CSS, and using Sheets as backend.

I have been **working since 2018** as a Data Analyst in the gaming industry in different esports teams, where I’ve used to manage **databases** to track thousands of players. Also in this role, I developed **frontend resources**, such as the dashboards I mentioned above, to improve my workspace.

Currently, I’m looking for a **new position** as a **Full Stack Developer** or **Frontend Developer**.
