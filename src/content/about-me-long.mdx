I'm a <Age date='1996-09-12T00:00:00.000Z' /> years old **Software Developer** focused on **frontend**, with <Age date='2019-12-01T00:00:00.000Z' /> years of experience. Formerly I was a **Data Analyst** in the mobile esports scene. 

I got graduated with a Bachelor of Science _(2013)_ and studied Electronic Engineering _(2014-2020)_.

My first coding experience was in 2013 with VBA, where I made tools to automate repetitive tasks, such as a script to organize my `downloads` folder by file extensions.

At the university, I learned some of C++, assembly, and MATLAB. Even I used to **teach C++** basics to other students.

My first experience with **web development** was in 2019, by doing dashboards with Google Apps Script, HTML, CSS, and Google Sheets. First it was for hobby, and later I made web pages from my own to help myself in my work as data analyst.

Currently, I'm **looking for a new position** as a **Frontend Developer**, where I would like to contribute with my knowledge and experience and also **grow** as a developer.
