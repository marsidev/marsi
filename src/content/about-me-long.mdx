I'm a <Age date='1996-09-12T00:00:00.000Z' /> years old **Software Developer** focused most on the **frontend**, with <Age date='2019-12-01T00:00:00.000Z' /> years of experience. I used to be a **Data Analyst** in the mobile esports scene where I was part in teams such as <Link color='pink.400' isExternal href='https://twitter.com/tribegaming'>Tribe Gaming</Link> and <Link color='pink.400' isExternal href='https://twitter.com/drxglobal'>DragonX</Link>.

I got graduated with a **Bachelor of Science** _(2013)_ and studied **Electronic Engineering** _(2014-2020)_. My first coding experience was in 2013 with VBA, where I made tools to automate repetitive tasks, such as a script to organize my `downloads` folder by file extensions. At the university, I learned some of C++, assembly, and MATLAB. Even I used to **teach C++** basics to other students.

My first experience with **web development** was in 2019, by doing dashboards with Google Apps Script, HTML, CSS, and Google Sheets. First it was for hobby, and later I made web pages from my own to help myself in my work as data analyst.

I've been working at <Link color='pink.400' isExternal href='https://anni.care'>anni.care</Link> as a **Software Engineer** since April 2023.
