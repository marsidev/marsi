I'm a **Full Stack Developer** and a **Data Analyst** with **4 years** of experience. I got graduated with a Bachelor of Science *(2013)*, and also studied Electronic Engineering *(2014-2020)*.

My first coding experience was in 2013 with Visual Basic for Applications, where I made tools to automate repetitive tasks, such as a script to organize my *downloads* folder by file extensions.

At the university, I learned some of C++, assembly, and MATLAB. Even I used to **teach C++** basics to other students.

My first experience with **web development** was in 2019, by doing dashboards with Google Apps Script, HTML, CSS, and Google Sheets.

I have been **working as Data Analyst since 2018** in the mobile gaming industry at different teams. Where I usually **manage databases** to track thousands of players, and also developed some **frontend resources**, such as the dashboards I mentioned above in order to improve and automate my workspace environment.

Currently, I'm **looking for a new position** as a **Full Stack Developer** or **Frontend Developer**, where I would like to contribute with my knowledge and experience and also **grow** as a developer.
